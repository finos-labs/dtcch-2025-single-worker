# Global Financial Market Data Harmonization Project

## Problem Statement
Despite post-2008 financial crisis reforms in derivatives trading and reporting, financial regulators face significant challenges in obtaining a comprehensive view of market activity due to:
- Inconsistent data formats across different jurisdictions
- Varying reporting standards between exchanges
- Multiple currency denominations
- Lack of standardized data elements
- Difficulties in cross-border data sharing and analysis

## Objective
Develop a machine learning solution to:
1. Harmonize financial market data across different exchanges
2. Create standardized reporting formats
3. Enable real-time risk assessment across global markets
4. Facilitate regulatory oversight through unified data analysis

## Important Terms:
1. **RSI** → Momentum and Reversal Points  
2. **MACD** → Trend Changes and Strength  
3. **Volume** → Confirmation of Price Moves  
4. **Volatility** → Risk Levels  
5. **Bollinger Bands** → Price Channels and Extremes

## Using DCO to sign your commits

**All commits** must be signed with a DCO signature to avoid being flagged by the DCO Bot. This means that your commit log message must contain a line that looks like the following one, with your actual name and email address:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

Adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` will add that line automatically. You can also add it manually as part of your commit log message or add it afterwards with `git commit --amend -s`.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
